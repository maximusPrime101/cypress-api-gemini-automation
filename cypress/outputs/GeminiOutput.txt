There are multiple visual differences between the two screenshots regarding text style and formatting.  Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Quantity of Changes:** At least 7 noticeable changes.  More subtle changes may exist.

**Specific Changes:**

1. **Main Article Title Font and Size:** The font of the main article title ("הלידה של ילדי שחר – איך זה קרה?") appears to be bolder and slightly larger in the second image.  The change can't be precisely expressed in CSS terms without access to the webpage's code, but it's a clear visual difference in weight and point size.  _Example of approximate description:_ `font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.1em;`

2. **Article Body Text:** The body text of the article in the second image appears to have slightly increased line-height or spacing between lines, making it more readable. This is difficult to quantify precisely without access to source code, but the visual difference in line spacing is notable. _Example of approximate description:_ `line-height: 1.6;`

3. **Sidebar Text:** The text in the sidebar (e.g., titles of related articles) seems slightly smaller in the second image.  _Example of approximate description:_ `font-size: 0.9em;`

4. **Footer Text:** The text in the footer of the second image has potentially undergone a slight change in font size and/or spacing.  _Example of approximate description:_ `font-size: 0.85em; line-height: 1.2;`

5. **Comment Section Text:** The text within the comment section ("תגובות") might have adjusted font size or color.  The difference is subtle and requires careful observation. _Example of approximate description:_ `font-size: 0.95em;`

6. **Navigation Bar Text:**  The text in the main navigation bar at the top of the page is subtly different in either size or spacing.  _Example of approximate description:_ `font-size: 1em; letter-spacing: 0.05em;`

7. **Author's Name (Under the Comments):** The author's name and details under the comments could have a different font, size or color.

It's important to note that without access to the source code, these descriptions are based on visual observations and are approximations of potential CSS changes.  The actual implementation may involve different attributes or a combination of attributes.
