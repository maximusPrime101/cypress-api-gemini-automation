Analyze and compare these two images. The BaseImage is the original version of a lyrics webpage, and the ManipulatedImage is the webpage after random style attributes have been applied. Your task is to focus exclusively on the lyrics text and perform the following actions:

1. **Identify and Measure Attributes**:
   - Analyze the lyrics text by breaking it into individual words.
   - For each word, measure and compare the following style attributes:
     - **Font size** (in pixels)
     - **Font-weight**
     - **Line-height**
     - **Letter-spacing** (in pixels)
     - **Text color** (use the color name, e.g., "red" or "blue")
     - **Background color** (if applied to the text)
     - **Padding and margin**
     - **Text alignment** (e.g., left, center, right)
   - Report changes only where differences exist between the BaseImage and ManipulatedImage.

2. **Focus Exclusively on the Lyrics**:
   - Ignore headers, footers, banners, or non-lyrics text.
   - If the lyrics text is partially visible or obscured, describe the issue and specify which words are missing or unclear.

3. **Comparison**:
   - For every attribute change, specify:
     - The original value in the BaseImage.
     - The changed value in the ManipulatedImage.
     - The exact difference (e.g., "Font size increased by 2px").
   - If attributes like font-weight and font size both contribute to a visual effect (e.g., bold text), combine them into a single explanation.

4. **Text Integrity**:
   - Compare the text in the BaseImage and ManipulatedImage.
   - Highlight any missing, overlapping, or additional words or characters.
   - If text is missing or altered, provide the exact missing or altered words.

5. **Precision Requirements**:
   - List only changes with a **detection confidence above 90%**.
   - If changes have a detection confidence of 50%-90%, mention them separately as "Possible changes."

6. **Output Requirements**:
   - Begin the response with:
     - "Yes - differences were found." if style differences exist.
     - "No - differences were not found." if no style differences exist.
   - Provide a list of identified differences in the following format:
     ```plaintext
     font-size: increased by 2px;
     font-weight: changed to bold;
     line-height: changed from 1.5 to 1.8;
     ```
   - Count the total number of differences and provide it in this format:
     ```plaintext
     Total differences identified: <number>.
     ```
   - Provide an explanation of how the differences affect the appearance of the lyrics.
   - State "True" if the text in both images is identical or "False" if it is not.

7. **Fallback Instructions**:
   - If the lyrics text cannot be accurately analyzed (due to visibility, quality, or obstruction issues), state:
     ```plaintext
     Unable to analyze lyrics due to <reason>. No valid comparison could be made.
     ```

8. **Output Lyrics**:
   - At the end of your response, copy the lyrics text you examined exactly as detected (do not translate). If you cannot detect the lyrics text, explain why and state "Lyrics text unavailable."
