"Analyze these two images. The first image is the original version of a lyrics webpage. The second image represents the webpage after specific style attributes have been randomly applied. Your task is to focus exclusively on the lyrics text:

1. List only the exact style attributes and their corresponding values that differ between the two images.

2. Focus exclusively on attributes that may have changed due to the applied manipulations, such as font-weight, text-decoration, color, zoom, and any other relevant attributes explicitly present in the test. Avoid listing multiple values for a single attribute or speculative changes. Avoid listing differences if the two images are identical.
if the probability of identifying attribute is over 80% list it.

Write your response in this format: <attribute>: <value>;

After listing the changes:
Count the total number of identified differences and provide it in this format: Total differences identified: <number>;

after counting:
short explanation about the differences that you found

At the beginning of your response:
Start with "Yes - differences were found" if style differences were identified. or 
Start with "No - differences were not found" if style differences were not identified.

At the end of your response:

Start with "Text is identical! \nTrue" if the lyrics text is identical in both images, or
Start with "Text is missing! \nFalse" if any part of the lyrics text is missing."
